# Portfolio Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

This project simulates historical stock price data and optimizes portfolio weights using a genetic algorithm.

## Overview

The program consists of the following files:

- `main.cpp`: The main program file where the user can input parameters and run the simulation.
- `Stock_simulator.cpp`: Contains functions to simulate historical stock price data using Geometric Brownian Motion.
- `Statistics.cpp`: Contains functions to perform statistical calculations such as mean, standard deviation, and covariance.
- `Genetic_algorithm.cpp`: Contains functions to implement the genetic algorithm for optimizing portfolio weights.
